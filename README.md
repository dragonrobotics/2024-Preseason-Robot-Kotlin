This is the code for our 2024 preseason robot, built for the 2024 Crescendo game.

The robot is designed with an under-bumper intake, and cann only score in the speaker.

This year, the team is trying Kotlin for the robot instead of Java for the first time, and this code was made to practice using it before season.
